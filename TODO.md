# TODO: Update ShsEnrollment Form to Match CollegeEnrollment

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Update stepper labels to match CollegeEnrollment (e.g., "Student Information" instead of "Student Info", "Educational Background" instead of "Backgrounds", "Referral" instead of "How did you hear about us?")
- [x] Update section headers to match CollegeEnrollment (e.g., "Step 7: Documents", "Step 8: Referral")
- [x] Update referral source options to match CollegeEnrollment ("Social Media", "Referral", "Walk-in")
- [x] Update JavaScript logic for referral toggle to use "Referral" instead of "Adviser/Referral/Others"
- [x] Update populateSummary function to handle referral logic correctly
